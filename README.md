# What Cuisine? Classifying cuisines based on recipes using multi-class classification

# Overview
We consider the problem of predicting the cuisine of
a recipe given a list of ingredients. Such classification can help
food databases and recipe recommender systems autonomously
categorize new recipes based on their ingredients. Results of
our evaluations show that a test set classification accuracy of
at least 77.87% is possible given a training set of 39,774 recipes,
significantly surpassing the accuracy of a baseline predictor that,
for each recipe, trivially guesses the most common cuisine.
